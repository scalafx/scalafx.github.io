### Introduction

Donations to the ScalaFX project are processed through Paypal. 
Funds are made to and under the control of the project leader (currently [Stephen Chin](http://steveonjava.com/)). 
We are not a non-profit organization at this time, so you cannot deduct taxes on your donation. 
If you are still interested in contributing, read on.

### What Donations Are Used For

Donations will be used for any of the following purposes:

* Spot incentives for contributing members (books, software, devices, beer)
* Travel and expenses for qualifying speaking engagements (need to get the word out)
* Hosting and advertising costs for infrastructure

### What Is In It For Me? (And My Company)

A good feeling that you are helping make the world a better place (or rewarding those who do).

If you are a company and you want something more tangible, please [contact Stephen Chin](http://steveonjava.com/) 
to become a project sponsor.  With a qualifying project sponsorship, you will get the following benefits:

* Promotional placement on the website, documentation, and all presentations
* Priority defect fixes
* 24/7 Support (basically the cell phone number of one of the lead developers)
